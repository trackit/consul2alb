== consul2alb

_consul2alb_ keeps an ALB target group’s list of instance-port couples with
Consul’s list of node-port couples for a given service name.

WARNING: This script assumes the Consul node names for your instances are
identical to their EC2 instance IDs.

=== How to

_consul2alb_ will listen to changes in Consul’s list of services for a given
service name, and on each change will issue an API call to update an ALB target
group. The script will keep running until you stop it. You can use the
Dockerfile if you don’t want to deal with dependencies.

The program needs two environment variables to be provided:

`CONSUL2ALB_SERVICE_NAME` ~Required~::
	The name of the service in Consul.

`CONSUL2ALB_TARGET_GROUP_ARN` ~Required~::
	The ARN of the ALB target group.
